    "name": "Complete Blood Count (CBC)",
    "description": "A Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a common blood test that evaluates the overall health of your blood and body. It measures various components of blood, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. RBCs carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, WBCs help fight infection and platelets aid in blood clotting. The CBC provides important information about your body's immune system, oxygen-carrying capacity, and clotting ability. Abnormal CBC results can indicate various blood disorders such as anemia, infection, inflammation, or leukemia.",
